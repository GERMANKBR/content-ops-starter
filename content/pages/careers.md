      Fruchtlabor ($FUL) is more than just a tokenâ€”it's a movement built on German precision 
      and AI-powered innovation. Our community-first approach means that every holder is 
      part of the team shaping the future of $FUL. With 100% of tokens distributed to the 
      community and no team allocations, we're creating a truly decentralized ecosystem where 
      everyone has equal opportunity to participate and grow.
